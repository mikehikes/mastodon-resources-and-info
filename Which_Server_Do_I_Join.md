# WSDOIJ: Which Server Do I Join?

Mastodon comprises a federation of websites that agree to exchange information with each other. (In some cases, Mastodon servers may choose to not exchange information - typically when the content of a server is objectionable to another server.

This is a non-exhaustive list of servers and recommendations, with a focus on newer users and US political stuff:

1. `mastodon.social`: This is a general server, based in Germany, that is currently the largest Mastodon server, and the home of some Members of Congress. 
   - Pros: Easy to join and no wait list
   - Considerations: Global focus, which can result in some info overload. Moderation and culture in the German/European context.

2. `mstdn.social`: This is a general server, based in the Netherlands, that is among the larger servers.
   - Pros: Easy to join and no wait list
   - Considerations: Global focus, which can result in some info overload. Moderation and culture in the Dutch/European context.

3. `mas.to`: Another general server
   - Pros: Easy to join and no wait list
   - Considerations: A bit slow, due to user growth.

3. `mastodon.world`: Another general server
   - Pros: Easy to join and good performance
   - Considerations: Stricter moderation; culture in the European context. Hosted in Germany and subject to German law.
